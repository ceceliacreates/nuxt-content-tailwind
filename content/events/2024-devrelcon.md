title: A Success-ful Approach to DevRel
date: 2024-07-18
description: Relating to the developer experience, ensuring devs are getting value from your product, and routing critical feedback to the right teams can all describe functions of a Developer Relations program. But, these are all also important to Customer Success teams. While metrics and methods may be different, there are many similarities between DevRel and Success teams in terms of the problems they work to solve. However, these teams donâ€™t always work well together, sometimes duplicating efforts or missing out on cross-functional opportunities. Based on my five years of experience in both Customer Success and DevRel at devtools companies, this talk will highlight some of the overlapping strategies, what DevRel can learn from Success, and how both teams can better collaborate to achieve their mutual goals.
