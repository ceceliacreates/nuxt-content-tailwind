title: Navigating the Low-Code Landscape
date: 2024-06-28
description: Not all low-code tools are created equally, and the level of code you use for your application depends on a number of factors. If your team has considered using a low-code tool, this talks reviews what you need to consider before making a decision. Weâ€™ll differentiate between low-code and no-code solutions and the pros and cons of each, as well as explore the spectrum of available platforms, discussing how they vary in terms of flexibility, scalability, and the level of coding expertise required.
