title: OutSystems 101 - UI
date: 2024-05-23
description: Welcome to the second post in the OutSystems 101 series! Web developers frequently interact with the concept of components â€“ reusable pieces of code that form UIs. In OutSystems, you can work similarly using Widgets and Blocks. If you are already familiar with concepts like reusable components, props or component inputs, the component lifecycle, and reactivity, building OutSystems UIs will feel very intuitive.
