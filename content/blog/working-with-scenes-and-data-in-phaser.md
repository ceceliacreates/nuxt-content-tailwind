title: Working with Scenes and Data in Phaser
date: 2024-05-04
description: Part three of a 4-part series on making a mobile game with Phaser. In this post, we’ll create our ScoreScene and set up the other views in our Vue app, About and Scores. This will involve using events to access the scores from the Phaser game in the parent Vue app to create a “High Scores” page.
