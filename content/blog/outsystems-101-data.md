title: OutSystems 101 - Data
date: 2024-04-05
description: This blog is the first in a series called OutSystems 101, and its objective is to help developers who use other technologies like React, Angular, or .NET quickly learn core concepts in OutSystems. It’s based on my experience learning OutSystems and “translating” my existing web development knowledge to its visual, low-code language. If you’re new to OutSystems, this guide will help you get up and running with basic data concepts to successfully build an app.
