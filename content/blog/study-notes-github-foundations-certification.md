date: 2024-07-16
description: "In February of this year I successfully passed the GitHub Foundations Certificate Exam. I have used GitHub for about five years and am a GitHub Star Alumni, so I felt fairly confident going into the study process. However, there were still some gaps in my knowledge and I wanted to be prepared. This post is a collection of links, resources, and my notes from the study process. Hopefully it is helpful to you for your own certification journey."
