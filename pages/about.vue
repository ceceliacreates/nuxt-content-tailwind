          Hi! I'm Cecelia Martinez. I am a developer, speaker, writer, and community leader who loves doing and learning about a little bit of everything. 
          As a DevRel professional, I am drawn to helping developers improve some of the most frustrating parts of their work - including testing, debugging, mobile app deployments, and fighting with YAML. 
          I'm currently a Lead Developer Advocate at <NuxtLink to="https://outsystems.com" external target="_blank">OutSystems</NuxtLink>, but you may know me from my previous work at <NuxtLink to="https://ionic.io" external target="_blank">Ionic</NuxtLink>, <NuxtLink to="https://replay.io" external target="_blank">Replay</NuxtLink>, or <NuxtLink to="https://cypress.io" external target="_blank">Cypress</NuxtLink>, or from one of the <NuxtLink to="/events">30+ events</NuxtLink> I've spoken at since 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can usually find me at a meetup - I lead the <NuxtLink to="https://atlantajavascript.com" external target="_blank">Atlanta JavaScript</NuxtLink>üçë and <NuxtLink to="https://outintech.com/atlanta" external target="_blank">Out in Tech Atlanta</NuxtLink>üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà groups, and believe that local developer communities are the beating heart of tech. 
          I have a broad technical background that includes everything from web development  and testing to mobile DevOps and leveraging low-code and AI. 
          I have a strong understanding of the business aspect of DevRel, thanks to an MBA in Marketing and a previous career in finance.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I'm really a teacher at heart. I love helping developers thrive by crafting effective technical resources, working with engineering teams to ensure quality products, and spreading the word about the tools that make developer lives better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I write primarily about developer relations, speaking, and community, and am available for events or to collaborate on content.
